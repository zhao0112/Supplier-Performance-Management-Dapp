**Supplier Performance Management Dapp**

This is the frontend application for a blockchain-based Supplier Performance Management system. The system utilizes smart contracts to automate and optimize the process of evaluating and managing supplier performance in supply chain operations.
Features
User-friendly interface for suppliers and administrators
Real-time visualization of supplier performance metrics
Interactive features for creating and managing orders
Secure access control and authentication mechanisms
Seamless integration with the underlying blockchain and smart contract
Customizable and scalable design to accommodate various business needs

**Technologies Used**
React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces

Web3.js: A collection of libraries for interacting with Ethereum

Axiomesh: A custom token developed by our senior for the project

Ethereum: A decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality

Solidity: A contract-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts

Getting Started
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/zhaozl0112/supplier-performance-management-dapp.git

Install dependencies:

npm install
Configure the environment variables (e.g., Ethereum network, smart contract address)
Start the development server:
npm start
Open the application in your browser at http://localhost:3000

**Smart Contract**

The frontend interacts with a smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. The smart contract is responsible for storing supplier performance data, managing orders, and executing the logic for evaluating supplier performance.
For more information about the smart contract, please refer to the Smart Contract Repository.
